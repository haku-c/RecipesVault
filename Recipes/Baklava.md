### Baklava 

>Notes: 
> -  Working with Filo Dough for Baklava:
>	- Plan ahead. Allow dough to defrost completely. Put in fridge overnight, then let defrost to room temperature a few hours before on the counter.
>	- Cut before baking. 
>	- Before baking, sprinkle with cold water. Keep dough covered with damp cloth/parchment paper
>	- Make sure the syrup is cooled before pouring
>	- Brush edges first, then the center to prevent cracks
>	- Brush the last layer (top) to seal
>	- ** Baking at 350 for 45 minutes with a shallower pan leaves things burnt in a Cascadilla oven. Check status halfway and two thirds of the way in and adjust accordingly. **
>	- Consider layering differently, perhaps more filo between filling layers could be an improvement. 
>	- The results on this recipe the first time were heavily burnt on the bottom (so as to be inedible).
>		- Possible modifications: deeper pan
>		- Lower temp or shorter baking time
>		- More butter in between layers. The store bought filo was pretty dry in general. 
### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [x] 25 sheets of Filo Dough 
- [x] 2 cups of butter
#### Filling 
- [ ] 2  to 2.5 cups of walnuts/pistachios
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) $\frac 1 2$ tbsp (4g) cinnamon powder or 
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) 1 tsp (2g) all spice 
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) $\frac 1 4$ tsp fresh grated nutmeg
- [ ] 3 tbsp sugar
#### Syrup
- [ ]  $\frac 2 3$  cup Granulated Sugar
- [ ] $\frac 1 3$  cup honey 
- [ ] 1 cup water
- [ ] Juice of 1/2 lemon
- [ ] Lemon or orange zest
- [ ] 1  cinnamon stick


### Substitutions and Modifications
> -  1 cup brown sugar instead of granulated
> - Sugar values are scaled to be 1 to 1 sugar and water
> - Use of cinnamon stick and orange peel in the syrup.

#### Supplies:
> - Preheat oven to 350
> - A reasonably sized baking sheet. Most recipes call for 9 by 13, presumably because premade filo seems to come in that size.
> - Brush, you can improvise using parchment paper
> - Something to grind or macerate nuts with

#### Directions
1. Make sure to adequately defrost the filo by thawing overnight in the refrigerator and letting it get to room temperature on the counter
2. Grind nuts into a coarse consistency (like gravel) using a food processor or some other method
3. Nut mixtures call for sugar cinnamon, and spices. Depends on preference. 
4. Cooking the syrup just involves mixing continually, setting it to high until boil, then going to medium or low and letting it reduce until desired consistency. Syrup does not need to be very thick (perhaps up to personal preference, I left it pretty thin)
5. Recipes also vary depending on the number of layers to nut ratio. For this, I'll do 3 layers of dough between nut layers: 3 filo, 1/3 of nut, 3 filo, 1/3 nut, 3 filo, 1/3 nut, 6 filo
6. Butter every filo layer pretty liberally. Follow layering configuration.
