### Babka

 >Notes: 
>- The original recipe calls for baking at 375, but that resulted in a little burning on the tops. Other recipes set it for lower, around 350 to 365. 
>- You'll want to start braiding from the center, laying the two ends in an "X" shape.
>- Make sure you dust off any excess flour, as it will prevent the layers from sticking together after cutting. 
>- When melting chocolate for a chocolate filling, make sure to do it in a double broiler with the heat set to low or medium. Ensure the water does not touch the bottom of the melting container. 
>- Square out the round dough by cutting an "X" shape into the top of the ball and folding the 4 segments outwards. Press down and you should get a squarish shape. [Visual Demonstration](https://youtu.be/IK31JETK95c?t=103)

#### Directions
1. Take out the butter and cube. Let sit on the counter until room temperature. 
2. In a small saucepan or a bowl in the microwave, warm the milk until it’s lukewarm but not hot (about 110 degrees). Add yeast and a pinch of sugar and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, until slightly foamy.
3. In an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, or in a food processor, mix together flour, sugar, the salt, and the vanilla. Beat or process in the yeast mixture and eggs until the dough comes together in a soft mass, about 2 minutes. If the dough sticks to the side of the bowl and doesn’t come together, add a tablespoon more flour at a time until it does, beating very well in between additions. 
4. Add half the butter and beat or pulse until the dough is smooth and elastic. Might need to mix for upwards of 10 minutes until dough clears the bowl and forms a ball. Beat in the rest of the butter and continue to beat or pulse until the dough is smooth and stretchy, another 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Butter a bowl for the dough. Form the dough into a ball and put into bowl to rise for 1 to 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel.
6. After rising, deflate the dough with your hands and put the bowl into the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
7. Roll out the dough into a rectangle. Make the rectangle at least as wide as the loaf pan and as tall as possible (for more layers).
8. Spread the filling on the dough sheet, leaving around half an inch of coverage on the edges. Keep the filling rather thin to avoid explosions. 
9. Roll the sheet up into a tube. Keep the tube tight and stretch it out a bit. lengthwise.
10. Put the tube into the freezer on a baking sheet for at least 15 minutes (helps with cutting). In the meantime, line a loaf pan with parchment paper and generously oil/butter the pan. 
	1. Tip for lining: cut your paper in a rectangle as wide as the loaf pan and use the excess as handles when you put it in. 
11. Cut the tube in half lengthwise. Braid the two halves together. 
12. Proof in the loaf pan for one and a half to two hours. As a tip, you can boil a pot of water and leave it uncovered in the oven. Place the loaf pan in the oven with the pot. This helps get a good rise. You want the bread to rise up to just reach the top of the pan. 
13. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and then bake for 35 to 40 minutes.
