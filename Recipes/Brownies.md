### Brownies
[Recipe Pic](../Assets/Brownies/recipe.jpg)

### Notes
>- 30 minutes might not have been enough time for baking in an 8 by 8 by 2 pan. The edge pieces were firm enough for consumption after 5 minutes of resting. The next day the middle pieces were much firmer (and to my liking).
>- A bit too sugary for my taste. Perhaps reduce the sugar and chocolate amount. Or use unsweetened chocolate.

#### Directions
1. Melt the butter, coffee, and the chocolate with a double broiler setup. Water is barely simmering and stir until mixture is melted and smooth. Remove from water and let cool.
2. Crack 2 eggs into a bowl. Mix eggs with mixer/fork until yolk and whites are mixed. Add sugar, salt, vanilla extract and beat until mixture is incorporated (recipe says until thick and light yellow color, but honestly ymmv). 
3. Mix in the cooled chocolate mixture in batches to the egg mixture. 
4. Add the flour after the chocolate mixture is incorporated and mix until no flour streaks remain.
5. Add batter to tray and bake for around 30 minutes depending on tray size
