### Crepes 

 >Notes: 
> - If you have a blender, use it.
> - If you don't have a blender, probably should sift the flour before you add. Clumps are hard to get out with a hand whisk. 
> - Don't add too much butter when cooking crepes of it won't crisp as much.
> - Make sure the batter is set on one side before flipping. 
> - Recipe below is for a one-person breakfast. 5 to 6 normal size crepes. 
> - Try to use a large spatula (easier to flip).
> 	- Can tilt the pan to help flipping.

#### Directions
1. Melt butter in a heatproof container.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients and whisk/use a blender to combine. Consider sifting the flour beforehand.
3. Put batter in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
4. Butter a pan. Put on medium heat.
5. Add roughly a quarter cup of batter to the pan. Swirl the pan immediately to get the batter to the edges (thin out crepe).
6. Cook on one side without touching the batter for roughly 45 seconds to a minute.
7. Flip the crepe to the other side and cook until that side is finished.
8. Rebutter the pan every 1 or 2 crepes.
