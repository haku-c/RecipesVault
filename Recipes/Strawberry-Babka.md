### Strawberry Babka

>Notes: 
> - Considering this recipe comes from a Basics with Babish page, I think the recipe may soon cease to exist on the site. Here's documentation with a strawberry filling which I much preferred to the given cinnamon filling. A fun tip for proofing: leave a pot of warm water in the oven with your proofing dough (covered). It's important to keep the dough moist while proofing. 
> - Just a tip: spread the filling very thin, otherwise when you roll it will spill out. 
> - Make sure the filling has a sizeable empty space border around the outside of the rolled out dough when spreading.

#### Directions
#### Day 1
1. Whisk together the flour and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Combine the egg, milk, sugar, vanilla extract (if using), and salt in a separate bowl.
3. Add the warm milk mixture and unsalted butter to dry ingredients.
4. Using the dough hook attachment, mix the dough until completely homogenous and a smooth, elastic dough has formed, about 6-8 minutes.
5. Turn the dough out onto an oiled work surface (can also use flour) and gently shape the dough into a roughly rectangular shape.
6. Thoroughly wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 
#### Day 2
7. Create the syrup. Refer to instructions below. 
8. Grease a loaf pan 
9. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough block into a 9 ½ inch by 15-inch rectangle. The dough should be about ⅛ inch thick. 
10. Spread the filling of choice onto the dough, then start rolling the short side of the dough towards the other. This should create a log about 9 ½ inches long. 
11. Using a long knife, slice each log in half lengthwise. With the cut-side facing up, twist the two halves around each other. Smash down the 2 separate ends of the babka halves together after they are intertwined. 
12. Transfer the shaped babka into the prepared loaf pans. Cover it with a damp towel and allow it to proof until it doubles in size, about 1-2 hours. Use the oven trick!
13. Transfer the babka to the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches at least 185 °F.
14. Remove the babka from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the babkas from the pans and allow them to cool completely before slicing. 
#### Directions for Syrup
1. In a shallow dish, sprinkle strawberries with sugar, cover, and refrigerate overnight (or for a few hours). The sugar draws out the natural sugars in the berries.
2. In a medium saucepan, add strawberries, lemon juice and heat to a simmer.
3. Stir frequently until jam thickens and bubbles cover the surface(about 30 minutes).
4. In a food processor, blend the jam until you have a puree-like consistency. Pour jam into a clean jar and let cool completely. (optional, if you are fine with a thicker consistency)
