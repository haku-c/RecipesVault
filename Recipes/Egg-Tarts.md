### Egg Tarts

 >Notes: 
> - Liquid ingredients into flour is better for less clumping when making the filling.
> - Oven at 500 degrees for 15 minutes
> - Always make sure your dough is cold before rolling and folding. We do not want the butter to smear. 
> - Try not to let the butter get too warm while you are laminating. Don't roll it out too thin either or it will stick and tear. Use lots of flour to ensure nothing sticks (unless you want it to). Probably want to keep butter in refrigerator until dough is entirely rolled out and ready to laminate.
> - When you are rolling the dough, make sure there is not too much flour: you want a compact roll so you want the dough to stick to itself. 
> - The dough will expand while baking. Try not to make the walls too thick. The filling will also rise (souffle) so don't overfill the mold. 
> - When thickening the milk + flour combination for the filling, whisk constantly from the very start and make sure to use low to medium heat. Otherwise, the mixture will clump and there will be solid bits in the filling. 
### Ingredients
#ingredients 
#### Dough for 12 tarts
- [ ] 80 grams of unsalted butter (for butter block)
- [ ] 60 grams of unsalted butter (for the dough itself)
- [ ] 150 grams of all purpose flour
- [ ] 2 grams of salt
- [ ] 3 grams of sugar
- [ ] 60 ml of water
#### Filling for 6 tarts (exactly 6, no more no less)
- [ ] $\frac {1} {3}$ cup water
- [ ] $\frac {1} {2}$ cup granulated sugar
- [ ] a cinnamon stick (this is unhalved from the original recipe)
- [ ] rind of one large lemon
- [ ] $\frac {1} {2}$ cup whole milk plus 3 tablespoons of milk
- [ ] $\frac {1} {4}$ cup all purpose flour
- [ ] 3 large egg yolks
### Substitutions and Modifications
> - The dough and filling recipes are from separate recipes because I am not using heavy cream in the filling. 
> - Did not use the appropriate egg tart molds. Used a muffin tin instead.
> - If you don't want to put your oven to 500, you can do 410 F for around 20 to 25 minutes.

#### Supplies:
> - Preheat oven to 500 Fahrenheit
> - Spatula for mixing the dough
> - Brush to keep flour off of dough when creating butter layers
> - A few heat proof bowls for syrup assemblage
> - Sieve to keep the filling smooth and strain out chunky bits.

#### Directions
#### Dough
1. Create a butter block by cutting up butter from a stick evenly. Cut up some parchment paper into a "gift wrap" for your butter, about 10 cm by 15 cm. Roll to about 3mm thickness in the wrapper to get a nice butter sheet. Make sure to roll this out into the corners of the wrapper. 
2. Refrigerate butter sheet for 30 minutes.
3. Dice 60g of butter into blocks and put into a bowl. 
4. Add the flour, salt, and sugar to the bowl. Mix the butter and flour with your fingertips until the dough is pebbly/breadcrumbs.
5. Add water. Use a spatula to mix your dough. Switch to using your hands once the dough starts taking shape. Mix until flour from the bowl is all incorporated. Wrap dough and place into refrigerator for 30 minutes. 
6. Take out dough and fold several times. Then, roll into a rectangle to the size of the butter sheet using a rolling pin. Pro tip, roll out into a somewhat flat sheet, then pull corners with hands into a more rectangular shape. 
7. Check to see if butter can be wrapped. Put butter on half of the dough. Fold over, rewrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
8. After taking out dough, roll it into a rectangle. Do a window fold (fold both sides to the center line, then fold in half—cheats to create more layers). Make sure not too much flour when folding (we want the dough to stick to itself).
9. Refrigerate for 30 minutes and repeat. 
10. Repeat for more layers. Alternate folding directions each set of folds. 
11. After final folding, then roll out to around 3mm thickness. Then create a roll with the dough. Try to keep the roll very compact; use your finger tips to roll. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, the longer the better (some recipes say at least 2 hours to overnight). 
#### Filling
1. Place the water, sugar, cinnamon and lemon rind in a medium saucepan and bring it to a boil. Cook a minute and then kill the heat and let sit. 
2. Remove from the heat and let it cool for at least 15 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
3. In a separate medium saucepan scald the milk (heat until up to the boiling point but don’t let it boil).  
4. Make a slurry with the flour and the tablespoons of milk. The slurry prevents clumping. Add the hot milk to the slurry in a stream while whisking. 
5. In a thin, steady stream pour the syrup into the milk/flour mixture, whisking constantly.
6. Return to the saucepan and cook the milk/flour mixture, whisking constantly over medium-low, until thick, 5 to 10 minutes.
7. Put the egg yolks in a heat proof bowl. Add the thickened milk mixture to the egg yolks and whisk until combined.
9. Pour the custard through a fine mesh sieve to strain out any chunky bits.
#### Assemblage
1. Cut roll into half an inch or 2 cm thick disks depending on the diameter of the disk.
2. Place disks into either the tart tin or a muffin mold and use your thumbs to press the dough into the shape of the mold. The dough can be spread quite thin; translucent in some areas. 
3. Allow the dough to sit in the refrigerator or freezer for 30 minutes to firm up (don't want the butter to be too warm). It holds shape better after having been cooled.
4. Pour the filling into the mold, about 80% of the way (the souffle will rise in the oven).
5. Bake at 500 F for around 15 minutes. Alternatively, 410 F for around 20 to 23 minutes.
6. Let cool on a wire rack before eating!
