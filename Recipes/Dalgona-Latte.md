#### Directions
#### Mega Dalgona
1. Heat the sugar and water over medium low to medium heat. Don't stir until the very end.

3. Turn off the heat and add baking soda. Vigorously stir. 
4. Volume should increase, mix to make sure no lumps of baking soda. Remove from saucepan onto parchment paper. 
#### Assembly
