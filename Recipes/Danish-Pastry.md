#### Directions
1. In a bowl, work 15 grams of your butter into the flour with your fingers.
2. Combine all dough ingredients in a stand mixer and mix until combined. Let the dough rest after dough is formed.
3. Form 2 butter squares with the remaining butter (should be one rectangle per butter stick)
4. Laminate dough. Fold a third of the dough over one butter rectangle. On top of the folded over portion of dough, place the other butter rectangle and fold over the other third of the dough. Use a brush to dust off any errant flour (we want dough to stick). Don't stretch the dough over the butter, drape it. Push the edges in to create a seal around the butter. 
5. Put the dough in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.
6. Take dough out of refrigerator and laminate (fold thirds and roll out). Repeat process of refrigerating and laminating for at least one more time and up to as many times as you want. Remember to dust off flour. 
7. Make your shapes and your fillings. Brush egg/milk/butter on your pastries before baking. 
8. Bake at 400 for 12 to 14 minutes if you use lemon curd filling (depends on size of pastry). 15 minutes yielded a bit of a burnt top. Perhaps 15 to 18 minutes with other fillings. 
#### Fillings
##### Orange Curd
1. Put the sugar in a pot. Zest the oranges into the sugar and press it into the sugar. Add the orange and lemon juice. 
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt. It's important to whisk well (preferably until no egg white streaks). The more streaks of egg white, the more egg whites will cook and need to be strained out. 
3. Slice the butter and put into a heatproof bowl.
4. Combine the eggs into the pot with the sugar. Whisk in the corn starch until no clumps and cook the mixture over medium low heat stirring continuously. 
5. Cook until thickened (coats back of spoon). Should be around 10 to 15 minutes of cooking depending on the heat. Make sure to use a heatproof spatula to stir continuously or things will stick!
6. Pour the thickened curd through a sieve into the butter. Scrape as much as you can! Mix with the butter until homogenous (butter melted completely). You'll strain out amounts of orange zest and cooked egg whites. 
7. Let mixture cool to room temperature and then place in refrigerator.
