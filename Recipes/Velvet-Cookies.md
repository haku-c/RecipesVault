### Velvet Cookies

 >Notes: 
 > Don't forget to check if your baking soda still works (using lime juice or other citrus)

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 210 grams all purpose flour
- [ ] 21 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] $\frac 1 4$ teaspoon salt
- [ ] 113 grams of unsalted butter (1 stick) at room temperature (set outside to soften)
- [ ] 130 grams light or dark brown sugar
- [ ] 50 grams granulated sugar
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 1 tablespoon milk (you can try buttermilk)
- [ ] 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- [ ] $\frac 3 4$ red food coloring (optional)
- [ ] 180 grams chocolate chips
### Substitutions and Modifications
> - I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. Common substitution. 
> - Instead of 1 tablespoon of milk, I used half tablespoon of cream and half tablespoon of water. Coconut sugar is drier than brown sugar and milk has much less fat than cream. Adding more fats with the cream while keeping the volume consistent. 
> - I used 20 grams less brown sugar than the linked recipe since it seemed like a lot of volume.

#### Directions
1. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl to combine. 
2.  Cream the butter with the granulated sugar and brown in a stand mixer. Use the paddle attachment and mix on medium until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix on high until combined about 1 minute. Periodically scrape the sides down as needed. 
3. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, adding milk and food coloring (optional). Mix on low speed until combined. Add the chocolate chips and mix on low. 
4. Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour (up to 3 days). If you keep the dough in the refrigerator for a long time, it won't spread in the oven that much, so you might need to flatten down the dough with a spoon before baking.
5. Roll the dough into balls (around 30 to 35 grams each) and place on a sheet lined with parchment paper. 
6. Bake at 350 for around 11 to 13 minutes. You can take out the cookies at the halfway mark to press down with a spoon to encourage spreading and add more chocolate chips on top if you want.
