### Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake 

 > Notes: 
 >- Do you like your cookies more cake than cookie? Then use a spoon to measure out your baking soda. 
 >- Do you like big cookies? Go for it. Sometimes size does matter. 
 >- Stacking your cookies makes them more 🌟*aesthetic*🌟in photos. 
 >- Pineapple in the background 🍍
 >- Real: recipe results were more cake than cookie. Most likely due to too much baking soda.
