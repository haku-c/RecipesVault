#### Directions
1. Prepare the brown sugar boba pearls. In a small saucepan, combine the water and brown sugar. Heat mixture over high heat until boiling. 
2. Reduce the heat to low and mix in half the tapioca starch with a rubber spatula, stirring constantly for 6-8 seconds. Remove from heat and mix in the rest of the tapioca starch until a dough just begins to form.
3. Dump the dough out onto a work surface and knead until a smooth dough forms, about 1 minute or so. Working quickly, as the dough will dry up if it cools too much, divide the dough into four equal pieces and roll each piece into a long rod that is Â½-inch thick. Cut the rod into small cubes and then roll the cubes into balls. If the dough does firm up too much, place it in the microwave for about 3 seconds or until it is pliable again.
