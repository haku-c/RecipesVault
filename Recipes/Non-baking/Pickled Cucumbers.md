### Recipe Name 

 >Notes: 
 >- If you use sushi rice vinegar, it is already seasoned, so you don't have to add sugar and salt.

>- Keeps for 2 days in the refrigerator
>- The measurements here are a baseline, my mom normally just adds everything to taste.

#### Directions
1. Cut the cucumber into thin semicircles. Cut carrot into matchsticks. 
2. Sprinkle the vegetables with kosher salt as if you were to season the vegetables.  Let the vegetables sit for half an hour to dehydrate them. Lightly press the moisture out of  the vegetables with your hands or a strainer. 
3. While the vegetables are drying out, make the sauce. Mix the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil in a separate bowl. Add sugar and salt to taste if not using sushi vinegar. My mom says this is all to taste so taste the mixture before adding to the vegetables.
4. Then combine the sauce and the vegetables. Make sure all the vegetables are covered by the liquid (submerged).
5. Cover the vegetables with plastic wrap. Let the vegetables sit in the refrigerator for an hour or two. 
6. To serve, transfer the desired amount of pickles to a separate bowl. You can discard the pickling liquid.
