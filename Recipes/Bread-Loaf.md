### Bread Loaf

 >Notes: 
 > - Lots and lots of esoteric tips for oven spring ahead:
 > - Preshaping is important. Try this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7eqwYLv2tI. 
 > - Keep the pan of water in the oven for two thirds of the baking time. 
 > - It would be good to be able to cover the bread for two thirds of the cooking time (dutch oven or other enclosure).
 > - Rotate the bread halfway through baking!
 > - Recipe amount below makes 1 nice size loaf (original recipe is doubled)
 > - Good to use wet hands while folding to avoid dough sticking to your hands.

#### Directions
1. Make the poolish beforehand by combining all the ingredients, stirring until combined, and letting ferment at room temperature for 4 to 24 hours.
2. Once poolish is ready, combine the poolish and the dough ingredients in a stand mixer and mix for 4 to 5 minutes on medium speed until no dry spots remain and the dough has begun to become cohesive. 
3. Cover dough and let sit 30 minutes.
4. Stretch and fold dough. Rest for another 30 minutes.
5. Stretch and fold dough. Rest for an hour. 
6. Preshape your dough. Follow whatever method you want. The goal is to build tension in the dough to facilitate oven spring. Let dough proof for around an hour (until doubled in size, time depends on temperature of the room). If you can, proof in a bowl lined with a kitchen towel.
7. Preheat oven and put in a pan while preheating. Add boiling water to the pan when you begin baking the bread. 
8. Bake for roughly 20 to 25 minutes, remove the pan after this. Then bake for another 10 to 15 minutes. The first time I baked this at 410 I baked for around 40 minutes all the way through.
