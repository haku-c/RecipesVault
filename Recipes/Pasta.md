### Pasta

 >Notes: 
 > - You can use just egg yolks (for a cooler color) or whole egg. Serves 3-4 people
 > - You will need to knead for 8 to 10 minutes to fully work in the dough. Maybe let rest for 5 minutes in between the kneading process to make an easier time. 
 > - Try to make a thick paste in the center well before you go in and mix with the bench scraper. Don't try to incorporate all the flour in at once. Watch the reference video for an example.
 > - Ensure you mix with a fork pretty well before going to the bench scraper.
 > - You can add some water to your fingertips (not your palm) if the dough is a bit too dry.

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 2 whole eggs
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] some salt
- [ ] 2 tbsp water (amount varies)
- [ ] 2 cups flour 
### Substitutions and Modifications
> - 00 flour is apparently best as well as usage of semolina flour. I just used all purpose. 
> - The recipe for only egg yolk has some very strange scaling that I will need to test out (220g flour to 12 egg yolks)
---
#### Supplies:
> - Bench scraper is very useful here to reshape the walls of the flour well and mix the flour in.

#### Directions
1. Form a well with the bottom of a bowl after you pour your flour onto the work surface.
2. Put the eggs, salt, and olive oil into the well. Mix ingredients with a fork taking care not to break the walls. 
3. Slowly incorporate the flour into the mixture with the fork. When you think it's ready (subjective) use the bench scraper to chop the flour into the eggs. Once a semblance of a dough forms, start kneading.
4. Knead until a cohesive ball of dough (8 to 10 minutes of earnest kneading). Add water or flour as necessary. Let dough rest for 5 minutes covered by a bowl or plastic wrap if becomes too hard to knead.
5. Once fully kneaded, let the dough rest for 30 to 45 minutes covered before rolling out.
