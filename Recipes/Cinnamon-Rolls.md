### Cinnamon Rolls

 >Notes: 
> - You really want to wait for the butter to soften before you try spreading it on the dough. It's hard to spread butter on the dough if it's not completely soft.
> - You'll want to use a thin wire (floss works) to cut the dough into rings.

#### Directions
1. Whisk together 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, salt.

3. Pour the water into the dry ingredients and mix in the egg.
4. Add 2 more cups of flour and mix. 
5. Add half a cup to a cup more flour and mix. Once it begins to come together, use your hands to knead. 
6. Keep kneading until the dough is no longer sticky. Add flour as needed. 
7. Shape dough into a ball and rest uncovered for 10 minutes.
8. Roll the dough out into a 10 by 15 inch rectangle sheet.
9. Spread the butter in an even layer on the sheet. Leave a half inch border around the top and bottom edge of the dough sheet. 
10. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and cinnamon. 
11. Roll the dough into a log. Try to keep it as compact as possible. Make sure the edges without filling are at the top and bottom. 
12. Cut the log into 12 pieces. Cut in half and so forth. 
13. Place the rolls into a sheet or tray that has been lined with parchment paper. Let proof for an hour.
